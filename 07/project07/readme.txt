Project 7: Virtual Machine, Part 1, Stack Arithmetic

The description for this project is found at:

https://www.nand2tetris.org/project07

You may _absolutely_ work as pairs on this project.

The default name for your file should be 'hvm.py'. If you name your file something else, just edit the "PythonFileName.txt" file to have the correct name.

We are now dealing with compiling programs exist in directories. For this project, you will need to look inside the directory, find the VM file and then create an ASM file inside the same directory. The name of the ASM file is the name of the directory.

Hints:

a) Use the proposed API in chapter 7 that splits the tasks across separate "modules."

b) The course notes start to get quite complex. I've broken things apart into smaller PDFs to help you find what you are looking for more quickly.

c) Starting now, you may work as partners on projects if you want. Make a plan for who is going to work on what parts, and then when you demonstrate your code, you will each need to talk through things with me and discuss how you divided work and collaborated.
