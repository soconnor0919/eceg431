What points were the most clear to you? (List up to 3)

- Lots of hardcoding, but it’s okay here (software brain scared)
- Symbolic references seem like a fun challenge. I’m sure I’m the only person to say this.
- This is just translation- Instruction X equals value Y. Just a bit more complicated. Spec will help.

What points were the muddiest and you'd like to talk more about? (List up to 3)

- I don’t like hardcoding. Magic numbers are bad.
- Are we going to end up optimizing later? Especially since this is a low-power CPU.
Grading comment:
Reflect on what you read.
Give me a sense about what is connecting to existing knowledge
-OR-
Your "ah ha!" moments
-OR-
What is hanging off by itself, not connecting.

I feel like I say this every time- but this is where it’s getting good. We have the system, we have the language, now let’s make the system recognize the language (kinda but not really, you get what I mean). Again calls back to CSCI 306, but we didn’t write our own assembler, just explored how it worked. RISC-V, although simple, isn’t as simple as this machine. I’m worried about my resistance to magic numbers and hardcoding, although that’ll be necessary here. I also am not so sure where to start. But that’s a later problem.
