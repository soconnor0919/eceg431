What points were the most clear to you? (List up to 3)

- Concept of clock cycles, separating out calculations into time units
- Flip Flops storing data

What points were the muddiest and you'd like to talk more about? (List up to 3)

- How do we maintain a clock with our current system? Everything just computes instantly so far, how do we modify what we have?
Grading comment:
Reflect on what you read.
Give me a sense about what is connecting to existing knowledge
-OR-
Your "ah ha!" moments
-OR-
What is hanging off by itself, not connecting.

So my first thought- concurrency?? already? This doesn’t sound good. But then I read on- starting to make sense. Clock cycles are expected, yet I thought they’d have come up with the ALU (but the ALU is simple enough). I remember building flip flops in Minecraft (not surprisingly), so that concept also makes sense. Other than that, the RAM seems to scale exponentially, but from an implementation perspective, it just seems like a bit of repetition- so that will be simple enough once the basic implementation is met. We’re scaling up rapidly here, yet the concepts still somewhat remain in grasp.
