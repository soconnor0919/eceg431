Reflect on what you read.
Give me a sense about what is connecting to existing knowledge

Your "ah ha!" moments

What is hanging off by itself, not connecting.

Starting to get a little muddy, but I’m still holding on. The parts of the CPU I knew, connecting it all makes sense, but I’m too used to linux and I’m confusing layers of complexity. Abstracting all of the functions into sections of the CPU is what’s going to hold it together, I think. Now it’s just taking the API spec and turning into something functional. We'll see how this goes.
