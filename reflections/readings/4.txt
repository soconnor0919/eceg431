What points were the muddiest and you'd like to talk more about? (List up to 3)

- Back to assembly… can we not? (kidding, but also not really.)
- Input/Output- we have predefined registers out of the ram range?
- Working with the screen seems intimidating- we’ll see how that goes. Any tips would be appreciated.
Grading comment:
Reflect on what you read.
Give me a sense about what is connecting to existing knowledge
-OR-
Your "ah ha!" moments
-OR-
What is hanging off by itself, not connecting.

As with project03, this project with assembly language is starting to overlap with CSCI 306- working with assembly. Although I didn’t necessarily like that part of the course, I understand it, and I’m hoping that will overlap now. The only problem I see myself facing in the near future is shedding my RISCV assembly tendencies and learning hack, which seems to have weird syntax comparatively. Otherwise, the instructions from a high level here make sense and appear to be straightforward.
