What points were the most clear to you? (List up to 3)

- The concept of binary addition, and subsequent operations
- Differences between a half and full adder, and how to connect them

What points were the muddiest and you'd like to talk more about? (List up to 3)

- The idea of an ALU made sense, but the concept of implementation was a little dense. I understand it now after working on the project for a bit.
Grading comment:
Reflect on what you read.
Give me a sense about what is connecting to existing knowledge
-OR-
Your "ah ha!" moments
-OR-
What is hanging off by itself, not connecting.

As with the prior chapter, this felt like review of CSCI 306- where we went over integer/binary addition, subtraction, etc. The idea of an ALU was touched on, but I feel like this is going to diverge a bit here- less in theory, more of implementation in this course. Again, I’m excited to see where this goes.
