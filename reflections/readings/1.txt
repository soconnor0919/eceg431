What points were the most clear to you? (List up to 3)

- Fundamentals of logic gates (or, and, not) made sense.
- Explaining how a NAND gate can make up the three fundamentals made sense.
Grading comment:
What points were the muddiest and you'd like to talk more about? (List up to 3)

- The idea of how a multiplexer functions makes sense, but its building blocks were kinda fuzzy (required external research).
- Same with a demultiplexer, but I have a better understanding now.
Grading comment:
Reflect on what you read.
Give me a sense about what is connecting to existing knowledge
-OR-
Your "ah ha!" moments
-OR-
What is hanging off by itself, not connecting.

The concepts of chapter 1 felt relatively simple. I understood logic gates and truth tables because of my prior courses, namely discrete math. The snippets of HDL and API descriptions also made a lot of sense to me, as I work on more complex API structures and took CSCI 306 with assembly covered. The idea of this course is exciting- I’ve worked on every individual segment before, but never have I gone from the fundamentals to a complete product. There’s usually layers of abstraction in my projects- working with existing frameworks, or stopping at a level where I show proficiency for a class assignment.
