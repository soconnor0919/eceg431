This project was somewhat easy, but it took a significant amount of time to bring back the concepts. It connected a ton to my discrete math and computer systems (in CS) course, and applied those concepts into creating fundamental logic gates, and extending them into (de)multiplexers and more gates. Setting up the environment was simple for me as well- I'm very comfortable in the terminal, and have configured editors for any possible file I could encounter already.
