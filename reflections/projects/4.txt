This project was definitely the most difficult yet, but made sense after a while. I started with laying out the actions of what's going on functionally, turned that into pseudocode comments. Most of my time then turned into translating RISC-V style pseudocode into functional code, and debugging. Assembly makes sense, but only after a while. Documentation is kinda all over the place.
