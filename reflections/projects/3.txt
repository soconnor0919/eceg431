This project felt more aligned with the information from CSCI 306: using program counters, storing information in registers, using low/high bits to find what to address. Learning what the DFF did took a bit of reading and re-reading- still fuzzy on that, but the videos helped. The program counter was a bit confusing, as I tried to build it without a register first; once I figured out I needed to store the counter I went back to the register. The RAM was straightforward- just scaled, and I needed to split the address to propagate downwards and find which bank(s) to reference.
