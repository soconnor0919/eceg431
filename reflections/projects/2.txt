Now we're starting to ramp up, and this is beginning to cause some internal conflict. Coming from computer science, and with my experience on low-power systems, I find optimization to be really important. Yet, in the ALU, I found it easiest to compute multiple values and then decide which one to keep, because you can't "build" a circuit after something is computed, rather, you have to prepare for all outcomes. Although the logic here seems Turing complete (without full analysis), it's a bit of a learning curve for me to think physically and not in terms of software.
